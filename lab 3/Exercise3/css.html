      <p> Hello I'm the jayhawk from KU. Did you know I've been through many iterations over the years? <br>
        if you didn't know that you should check out exercise 2! I find that KU is a great home. <br>
        KU is located in Lawrence where I reside in front of Strong Hall. Hope to see you there. <br>
